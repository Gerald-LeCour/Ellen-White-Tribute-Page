# Ellen G White Tribute Page

Hello, I wanted to make a tribute page to someone I admire, that being Ellen G White who is one of the founders of the Seventh Day Adventist church and also has a gift of prophecy. 
I tryed learning how to code over a year ago but then i stopped for a long time, but now I wanted to come back and try to freshen up my skills that I used to have.
It took me a while just to make this but I am proud of myself for making this. The only thing this is missing is that its not mobile friendly, it... it looks garbage on mobile.
